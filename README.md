### Supported champions
If you play with one of these champions, you will see animations for their abilities.

- Jax

## Usage
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nicolasdeory/leagueoflegends-led/releases)
- Setup a LED strip that listens to color data via sACN. If you don't have a LED strip, you will be able to see the simulated LED display in your screen. Alternatively, if you have a Razer Chroma Keyboard, the program should work out of the box!
- Open the program (`LedDashboard.exe`). It will default to Razer Chroma mode. If you want to use it with an LED strip, click on "Use LED strip".
- Load into a League of Legends game or Fornite or Rocket League
- Enjoy the lights!

## Roadmap / Planned Features
- Animation sets for each champion and active ability item
- Effects for summoner spells
- Add support for different keyboard brands and more RGB devices

## Known Issues
- Window focus isn't taken into account
- Game chat isn't taken into account (keypresses are treated as ability casts)
